* 2Do is a To Do List desktop application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* This is designed to allow users to efficiently manage their tasks.
* It is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written code example that is significantly bigger (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* This project is initiated by the sample project created by SE-EDU.
